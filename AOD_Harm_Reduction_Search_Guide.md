## 1. Introduction: Why this guide exists

Google dorking (advanced search operators) helps AOD workers cut through noise and find the _actual document_, _original dataset_, or _current guidance_—especially when things are buried in PDFs, hidden in “publications” directories, or published without strong SEO.

**Why use Google Dorks?**

- **Find government documents** before they are properly indexed or linked on homepages.
- **Locate hard-to-find service directories** that aren't advertised.
- **Track down research evidence** and grey literature efficiently.
- **Monitor drug alerts** across jurisdictions in real-time.
- **Discover unpublished reports**, submissions, and "buried" PDFs.

**This guide is NOT about hacking.**
We do not use search operators to find vulnerabilities, exposed credentials, private client records, or anything that could harm people or services. This guide is about **legitimate discovery of public information** that supports harm reduction work.

**Centering Peer and Lived Experience Perspectives:**
This guide is written with deep respect for peer workers and people with lived experience of drug use. Peer knowledge is expert knowledge. This guide helps you find:

- **Peer-led research and evaluations** that center lived experience
- **Peer workforce development** resources and frameworks
- **"Nothing About Us Without Us"** - Policy work by and for people who use drugs
- **Peer advocacy and campaign materials** that challenge stigma
- **Peer supervision, support, and wellbeing** resources

---

## 2. Safety, Ethics, and Privacy Rules (Non-negotiables)

### 2.1 Do no harm with search

Use these practices when searching sensitive topics:

- **Avoid searching for identifiable people** (names + “overdose” / “positive result” / “incident”) unless it is clearly in the public interest and you have organisational approval.
- **Do not seek leaked or exposed personal data.** If you accidentally find it, **stop**, record the URL privately per policy, and escalate via your organisation’s information security pathway.
- **Prefer de-identified, aggregated sources** (public health alerts, reports, published datasets).

### 2.2 Trauma-informed and stigma-free search terms

Google indexes the language _used at the time_. You may need to use stigmatising terms to find older documents, but always prefer people-first language in your own documentation.

- **Prefer:** `"people who use drugs"` over `"drug addicts"`
- **Prefer:** `"overdose"` / `"poisoning"` over `"ODed"`
- **Legacy Searching:** Include variants only when necessary to locate legacy documents:
  - `("people who use drugs" OR "drug user" OR "injecting drug use" OR "IDU")`

### 2.3 Legal & Clinical Currency

- **Respect Copyright:** content found via dorks is subject to the same copyright content found via normal search.
- **Clinical Guidance is Time-Sensitive:** For anything clinical (withdrawal, overdose management, dosing), always check:
  - **Publication date**
  - **Issuing authority**
  - **Jurisdiction**
  - **Currency (last updated)**

---

## 3. Quick Start: The 90-Second Workflow

When you need _anything_ fast:

1. **Define the task** (alert / policy / service / evidence / training).
2. **Choose the authority domain** first: `site:*.gov.au` or a known org/university.
3. **Force document formats**: `filetype:pdf` (or `docx`, `pptx`, `xlsx`).
4. **Use exact phrases** for program names: `"take-home naloxone"` `"needle syringe program"` `"drug checking"`
5. **Add a date constraint**: `after:2023-01-01` (or a range `2020..2024`)
6. **Exclude junk**: `-jobs -careers -news -opinion -pdfviewer`
7. **Open 2–3 candidates**, cross-check dates, and capture citations.

## 4. Core Operators (The Essentials)

These are the operators you will use daily. Master these first.

### 4.1 Essential Search Operators

| Operator        | Purpose                                                       | Example                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`-`**         | Exclude terms/sites. Removes noise.                           | "harm reduction" -jobs -careers; `site:*.gov.au -site:news.gov.au`; `"drug policy" -news -opinion`                                                       |
| **`..`**        | Number range (dates, prices, measurements).                   | "overdose" Australia 2020..2025; `festival attendance 10000..50000`                                                                                      |
| **`" "`**       | Exact phrase matching. Finds these words in this exact order. | "drug checking trial"; `"supervised injecting facility"`; `"peer-led harm reduction"`                                                                    |
| **`*`**         | Wildcard. Matches any word.                                   | "drug _ service" (finds: drug treatment service, drug checking service); `"_ harm reduction"` (finds: festival harm reduction, community harm reduction) |
| **`after:`**    | Documents published after a date (YYYY-MM-DD).                | `site:*.gov.au "overdose" after:2024-01-01`; `"drug alert" after:2025-01-01`                                                                             |
| **`before:`**   | Documents published before a date.                            | "drug policy" before:2020-01-01; `festival harm reduction before:2023`                                                                                   |
| **`filetype:`** | Find specific document types (pdf, xlsx, pptx, docx).         | `filetype:pdf "harm reduction"`; `filetype:xlsx "service directory"`; `filetype:docx policy submission`                                                  |
| **`intext:`**   | Search within page body text only.                            | `intext:"peer worker" training`; `intext:"lived experience" supervision`                                                                                 |
| **`intitle:`**  | Search only within the page title.                            | `intitle:"drug alert" site:*.gov.au`; `intitle:"health warning" opioid`; `intitle:"annual report" harm reduction`                                        |
| **`inurl:`**    | Search within the URL string itself.                          | `inurl:publications filetype:pdf`; `inurl:submissions harm reduction`; `inurl:aod-services`                                                              |
| **`OR`**        | Boolean logic. Search for _either_ term. Must be UPPERCASE.   | `("pill testing" OR "drug checking")`; `naloxone OR narcan OR Nyxoid`; `festival OR "music event"`                                                       |
| **`site:`**     | Limit to a specific domain or TLD.                            | `site:*.gov.au "drug alert"`; `site:health.nsw.gov.au naloxone`; `site:*.edu.au harm reduction`                                                          |

## 5. Advanced Operators & Techniques

### 5.1 `allintitle:` and `allinurl:`

Force _multiple_ words into the title or URL. Highly restrictive but high precision.

- `allintitle: drug alert opioid`
- `allinurl: publications naloxone pdf`

### 5.2 `AROUND(n)` proximity searching

Useful when documents don’t use your exact phrase but words appear near each other.

- `"naloxone" AROUND(5) "program"` (Finds "program for the distribution of naloxone")
- `"drug checking" AROUND(8) evaluation`

### 5.3 `intext:`

Search for words specifically in the body text (ignoring title/URL).

- `intext:"peer worker" training`

### 5.4 `related:` and `cache:`

- `related:ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au` -> Finds similar research websites.
- `cache:health.gov.au/drug-checking` -> View Google's cached version if the page is down or changed (note: Google is phasing this feature out, but it still works in some regions/contexts).

### 5.5 “Directory Mining” Patterns

When you suspect PDFs are sitting in a publications directory without a clear link.

- `site:health.nsw.gov.au inurl:publications filetype:pdf naloxone`
- `site:*.gov.au inurl:uploads filetype:pdf "harm reduction"`

### 7.15 Creative & Investigative Searching (With Ethical Guardrails)

_Finding buried, niche, obscure, and unusual content through creative dorking. Use responsibly._

> ⚠️ **ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATIVE SEARCHING**
>
> These techniques can surface sensitive, obscure, or "hidden" information. Before using them:
>
> 1. **Ask:** Is there a legitimate harm reduction purpose?
> 2. **Consider:** Could this information cause harm if misused?
> 3. **Check:** Does your organisation have policies on investigative research?
> 4. **Protect:** Never expose personal data or breach privacy
> 5. **Document:** Keep records of what you searched and why
>
> The purpose is always to **help people who use drugs, support advocacy, or hold systems accountable**—never to harm individuals or organisations.

### 7.18 Stigma, Language & Historical Research

_Understanding how language has changed and finding historical documents using legacy terminology._

> **Why This Section Exists:** Language matters. The words we use shape how people who use drugs are treated. However, to find historical documents, you sometimes need to search using the language of that era—even when it's stigmatising. Use these searches thoughtfully.

**Tracking Language Change:**

```txt
"people who use drugs" OR "person who uses drugs" (definition OR meaning OR "why we say")
"stigma" "language" drug use harm reduction
"people-first language" drug OR substance use
"from 'addict' to 'person'" language change
("terminology" OR "language") harm reduction guide
"words matter" drug OR substance use campaign
```

**Finding Documents Using Historical/Stigmatising Terms:**
_(Use when you need to locate older documents)_

```txt
# Older terminology (for historical research):
"drug addict" OR "drug abuser" Australia 1980..2010 filetype:pdf
"intravenous drug user" OR "IVDU" Australia harm reduction
"substance abuser" policy OR program Australia before:2015
"junkie" OR "druggie" (media OR news) Australia analysis

# Compare language across eras:
"injecting drug user" OR "IDU" 1990..2010 Australia
"people who inject drugs" OR "PWID" 2010..2026 Australia
```

**History of Harm Reduction in Australia:**

```txt
"harm minimisation" Australia history OR origins 1980s OR 1990s
"needle exchange" Australia first OR "pilot program" history
"methadone program" Australia history OR establishment
"AIDS response" Australia "injecting drug use" 1980s
"supervised injecting" OR "medically supervised injecting" Sydney history OR origins
"Kings Cross" injecting room history OR campaign
```

## 8. Workflows & Pro Tips

### 8.1 The "Source Ladder" (Validity & Trust)

When assessing documents, prefer sources in this order:

1. **Govt Health Authority** (`*.health.*.gov.au`, `aihw.gov.au`) - Official policy, alerts, guidelines
2. **University / Research Institute** (`*.edu.au`, NDARC, Burnet) - Peer-reviewed evidence
3. **Reputable Sector Org / Peak Body** (`*.org.au`, NUAA, AIVL) - Practice wisdom, lived experience
4. **Everything else** (blogs, media) = **context only**, not primary evidence

**Always verify:**

- Publication date / last updated
- Author credentials and affiliations
- Issuing authority
- Jurisdiction (NSW guidance ≠ WA guidance)

### 8.2 Research Workflow: Four-Step Funnel

#### Step 1: Get the Landscape (Broad)

```txt
"drug checking" Australia
```

#### Step 2: Focus on Jurisdiction

```txt
"drug checking" NSW site:*.gov.au
```

#### Step 3: Find Specific Documents

```txt
site:health.nsw.gov.au filetype:pdf "drug checking trial" evaluation
```

#### Step 4: Filter by Recency

```txt
site:health.nsw.gov.au filetype:pdf "drug checking trial" after:2024-01-01
```

### 8.3 Cross-Reference Workflow (Triangulation)

When researching a topic, search three perspectives:

**1. Government Position:**

```txt
site:*.gov.au "drug checking" (position OR statement OR policy)
```

**2. Research Evidence:**

```txt
site:*.edu.au filetype:pdf "drug checking" (effectiveness OR evaluation)
```

**3. Peer/Sector Perspective:**

```txt
site:*.org.au "drug checking" (advocacy OR support OR "lived experience")
```

### 8.4 Quality Control & Junk Removal

**If results are messy, add these exclusions progressively:**

**Level 1 - Remove job listings:**

```txt
-jobs -careers -position -vacancy -"job description" -employment
```

**Level 2 - Remove aggregators and paywalls:**

```txt
-site:researchgate.net -site:academia.edu -site:scribd.com -site:pinterest.com
```

**Level 3 - Remove news opinion (find the source):**

```txt
-news -opinion -editorial -comment -site:news.*
```

**Level 4 - Remove PDF viewers:**

```txt
-pdfviewer -flipbook -issuu -docplayer
```

**Force document types to skip webpage summaries:**

```txt
filetype:pdf
```

### 8.5 Finding Original Sources (Not News Coverage)

When a news article mentions a report:

**Skip the news, find the report:**

```txt
"drug checking trial" filetype:pdf -site:news.*-site:*.com.au/news
```

**Find primary research, not summaries:**

```txt
intitle:"methods" OR intitle:"methodology" "harm reduction" filetype:pdf
```

### 8.6 Monitoring & Early Warning Systems

> **⭐ RSS & Monitoring Tools:**
> Don't rely on manual checks. Set up automated monitoring for harm reduction intelligence:
>

> - **[Distill.io](https://distill.io/)** - Monitor websites and get alerts for changes
> - **[Follow That Page](https://followthatpage.com/)** - Email alerts when webpages change
>
> **Government Alert Feeds:**
> Many Australian government sites have RSS feeds. Check for these URLs:
>
> - `[site]/rss` or `[site]/feed`
> - `[site]/news/feed`
> - `[site]/media-releases.rss`
>
> **Tip:** Use RSS Bridge to create feeds from government pages that don't offer RSS natively.

#### A. Set Up Google Alerts

Use any dork as a Google Alert query. Examples:

- `site:*.health.*.gov.au ("drug alert" OR "public health alert")`
- `("nitazene" OR "benzimidazole opioid") site:*.gov.au filetype:pdf`
- `"drug checking" Australia filetype:pdf after:2025`

#### B. Weekly Sweep Routine (15 minutes)

Run these 3 searches every Monday, updating the date:

**1. Alerts (Priority):**

```txt
site:*.health.*.gov.au intitle:"drug alert" after:2026-01-22
```

**2. Research (Evidence Updates):**

```txt
site:*.edu.au filetype:pdf ("overdose" OR naloxone OR "drug checking") after:2026-01-22
```

**3. Policy (Legislative/Strategic Changes):**

```txt
site:*.gov.au filetype:pdf ("harm reduction" OR "drug policy") after:2026-01-22
```

#### C. Monthly Deep Dive

Once per month, run jurisdiction-specific searches:

```txt
site:health.nsw.gov.au filetype:pdf after:2026-01-01
site:parliament.*.gov.au "drug" (inquiry OR committee) after:2026-01-01
```

### 8.7 Building Citation Lists

**Find systematic reviews & meta-analyses:**

```txt
intitle:"systematic review" harm reduction intervention
intitle:"meta-analysis" needle syringe program effectiveness
```

**Find recent high-quality evidence:**

```txt
(intitle:"randomized controlled trial" OR intitle:"systematic review") "harm reduction" after:2020 filetype:pdf
```

**Locate Australian-specific evidence:**

```txt
site:*.edu.au "harm reduction" (evaluation OR effectiveness OR outcomes) filetype:pdf after:2020
```

### 8.8 Peer-Centered Search Workflow

When searching for information to support peer work, use this values-based approach:

#### Step 1: Check Peer Organizations First\*\*

```txt
site:nuaa.org.au OR site:aivl.org.au OR site:quihn.org [your topic] filetype:pdf
```

#### Step 2: Look for Peer-Led Research\*\*

```txt
[your topic] ("peer-led" OR "participatory" OR "co-designed") research filetype:pdf
```

#### Step 3: Find Lived Experience Representation\*\*

```txt
[your topic] ("lived experience" OR "peer perspective" OR "user voice") filetype:pdf
```

#### Step 4: Ensure "Nothing About Us Without Us"\*\*

Before using any research or policy document, ask:

- Were people with lived experience involved in design and delivery?
- Are peer voices quoted and centered?
- Does this respect the expertise of people who use drugs?

**Red Flags in Search Results:**

- Documents that talk _about_ people who use drugs without any peer authorship
- Research done _on_ communities without _with_ communities
- Policy developed _for_ peers without peer input
- Stigmatizing language that isn't critiqued

### 8.9 Building a Shared Evidence Log

Create a lightweight spreadsheet with these fields:

| Field                | Purpose                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Caveats**          | Limitations, outdated info, jurisdiction-specific     |
| **Date Retrieved**   | When you found it                                     |
| **Document Type**    | Alert, Guideline, Research, Policy                    |
| **Issuer**           | Organization/department                               |
| **Jurisdiction**     | NSW, VIC, Commonwealth, International                 |
| **Key Takeaways**    | 3 bullet points                                       |
| **Publication Date** | When it was published/updated                         |
| **Relevance**        | Practice / Policy / Training / Advocacy               |
| **Retrieved By**     | Your name                                             |
| **Title**            | Full document title                                   |
| **URL**              | Direct link (government URLs can rot - save the PDF!) |

---

## 9. Templates: Briefings & Citations

### 9.1 60-second Briefing Snippet

Use this to summarize findings for your team:

> **Topic:** [e.g. New Nitazene Alert]
> **What changed / why it matters:**
> **What we know (source + date):**
> **What we don’t know yet:**
> **Practical implications for workers:**
> **What to tell clients (plain language):**
> **Referral pathways / services:**

### 9.2 Citation Capture Shortcut

When you open a PDF, immediately note:

- Title, Publisher/Authority, Date.
- **Legacy Check:** If no date is visible, search the PDF text for "©" year or "version".
- **URL & Filename:** Save these immediately; government URLs often rot.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting: When Google Fails

### 10.1 Zero Results?

- **Remove `filetype:`** first. The info might be on a webpage, not a PDF.
- **Loosen `site:`** restrictions (e.g., change `site:health.nsw.gov.au` to `site:nsw.gov.au`).
- **Swap Terminology:**
  - “harm minimisation” vs “harm reduction”
  - “opioid pharmacotherapy” vs “OAT/OST”
  - “public health warning” vs “drug alert”
- **Use `AROUND(n)`** for looser phrasing.

### 10.2 Too Many Results?

1. Add `"exact phrases"`.
2. Add `filetype:pdf`.
3. Add `site:*.gov.au`.
4. Add `after:YYYY-MM-DD`.
5. Add exclusions (`-news -opinion`).

### 10.3 Filtering Out Stigmatizing Content

As a peer worker, you may want to avoid stigmatizing or harmful content:

**Exclude stigmatizing language (when appropriate):**

```txt
[your search] -"drug addict" -"drug abuse" -"substance abuse" -junkie
```

**Prioritize people-first language:**

```txt
"people who use drugs" OR "people who inject drugs" [your topic]
```

**Find peer-reviewed vs peer-led:**

```txt
## Peer-reviewed (academic)

site:*.edu.au [topic] filetype:pdf

## Peer-led (lived experience)

site:*.org.au "peer-led" [topic] filetype:pdf
```

**Note:** Sometimes you need to search using stigmatizing terms to find older documents or understand how language has changed. That's okay—just be aware of the context.

### 10.4 Broken Link or Deleted Page?

> **⭐ Web Archiving & Recovery Tools:**
> Government URLs frequently break. These tools help you find cached and archived content:

## 12. Final Thoughts & Best Practices

Google Dorks are powerful tools for cutting through information overload and finding exactly what you need for harm reduction work. Whether you're preparing briefings for peer workers, finding evidence for policy submissions, locating service directories, or tracking drug alerts, these techniques will save you time and improve your results.

### 12.1 Getting Started

- **Start with the basic operators** - Master `site:`, `filetype:`, and exact phrases first
- **Experiment with combinations** - Try different operator combinations to see what works
- **Build your own library** - Save useful dorks that work for your specific needs
- **Share with colleagues** - Harm reduction is collaborative work

### 12.2 Privacy & Information Management Principles

**Remember:**

- Use for legitimate research/work purposes only
- Respect copyright and terms of use
- Don't scrape or download bulk content without permission
- Cite sources appropriately
- Be mindful of sensitive information you may encounter
- Follow your organization's information policies

**Privacy considerations:**

- Some searches may reveal personal info (names, emails in PDFs)
- Be careful with cached pages of sensitive content
- Consider using private/incognito mode for sensitive searches
- If you accidentally find exposed personal data, stop and report per your org's protocols

### 12.3 Continuous Learning

**As you use this guide:**

- Test dorks regularly and note which ones work best for your needs
- Share successful patterns you discover with the harm reduction community
- Stay updated as Google's algorithms and operators change
- Contribute back - if you find something useful or a dork stops working, share that knowledge

**Ways to improve your searching:**

- Join OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) communities to learn advanced techniques
- Explore information literacy resources
- Learn about complementary tools (Zotero, RSS readers, browser extensions)
- Practice regularly - dorking is a skill that improves with use

### 12.4 Most Important: Share Knowledge & Center Peer Wisdom

Harm reduction is collaborative work, and that includes sharing the tools we use to do it better.

- **Share useful dorks** with colleagues and your network
- **Document what works** in your organisation
- **Train new staff** on these techniques
- **Contribute to sector knowledge** by sharing findings and improvements

**For Peer Workers Specifically:**

- **Your experiential knowledge is expert knowledge** - trust what you know from lived experience
- **Peer wisdom often isn't in academic databases** - check peer organisation sites first
- **"Nothing About Us Without Us"** applies to information searching too - prioritise sources that include peer voices
- **Share peer resources** with clinical and research colleagues who may not know where to find them
- **Challenge documents** that don't include peer perspectives - use these search skills to find better sources
- **Build peer knowledge archives** - save important peer publications that might disappear

**Peer-to-Peer Knowledge Sharing:**

- When you find a great peer resource, share it with other peer workers across the country
- Consider creating shared folders or databases of peer-led research and resources
- Support emerging peer workers to develop these search skills
- Remember: peer knowledge is often oral, informal, and lived - not everything valuable will be in a PDF

### 12.5 A Note on Creative and Investigative Searching

This guide includes techniques for finding obscure, buried, and sensitive content. These are powerful tools that should be used responsibly:

- **Always consider your purpose** - Is this search in the public interest?
- **Respect privacy** - Never seek to expose personal information
- **Follow organisational policies** - Check what's appropriate in your context
- **Document your searches** - Keep records of what you searched and why
- **Share carefully** - Some findings may need careful handling before sharing

The goal is always to find information that helps people who use drugs, supports better services, enables advocacy, or holds systems accountable.

### 12.6 Acknowledgements

This guide exists because of decades of peer organising and harm reduction practice in Australia. We acknowledge:

- **The peer workers** who have always known what their communities need
- **Drug user organisations** that have fought for evidence-based harm reduction
- **Researchers** who have partnered with communities to build the evidence base
- **Clinicians and services** committed to non-judgmental care
- **Advocates** who continue pushing for better drug policy
- **People with Lived or Living Experience** - your experiences matter
