## 🎯 Why This Guide Exists

Google dorking (advanced search operators) helps AOD workers cut through noise and find the _actual document_, _original dataset_, or _current guidance_—especially when things are buried in PDFs, hidden in "publications" directories, or published without strong SEO.

**Use cases:**
- Find government documents before they are properly indexed
- Locate hard-to-find service directories
- Track down research evidence and grey literature
- Monitor drug alerts across jurisdictions in real-time
- Discover unpublished reports, submissions, and "buried" PDFs

**This guide is NOT about hacking.** We use search operators for **legitimate discovery of public information** that supports harm reduction work.

---

## 👥 Centering Peer & Lived Experience

This guide is written with deep respect for peer workers and people with lived experience of drug use. **Peer knowledge is expert knowledge.**

This guide helps you find:
- Peer-led research and evaluations that center lived experience
- Peer workforce development resources and frameworks
- "Nothing About Us Without Us" - Policy work by and for people who use drugs
- Peer advocacy and campaign materials that challenge stigma
- Peer supervision, support, and wellbeing resources

---

## ⚖️ Safety, Ethics & Privacy

> **Non-negotiable principles for ethical searching.**

### Do No Harm
- **Never search for identifiable people** (names + "overdose" / incidents) unless clearly in public interest with organisational approval
- **Never seek leaked or exposed personal data** - if found accidentally, stop and escalate via your org's security pathway
- **Prefer de-identified, aggregated sources** (public health alerts, reports, datasets)

### Trauma-Informed Language
- **Prefer:** `"people who use drugs"` over `"drug addicts"`
- **Prefer:** `"overdose"` / `"poisoning"` over stigmatizing terms
- **Legacy searching:** Include older terms only when necessary to locate historical documents

### Legal & Clinical Currency
- Respect copyright
- For clinical guidance: always verify publication date, issuing authority, jurisdiction, and currency
