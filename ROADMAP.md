# Ideas for Dork Enhancement

**1. Add Top/Suggested Keywords in Keywords Block:**

    - Add keywords for smart filtering such as "Peer" and "X" and build them into the dork builder interface in the keywords block.

**2. Fix Theme Colour-Selector and Dark/Light Switcher:** - Ensure the theme colour-selector is
present in the menu with the dark/light switcher and that both the toggle and selectors are
functional.

**3. Add instant dork to docs cards:**

    - Add an "Instant Dork" button to dork code blocks in the docs next to the copy button that searches the dork immediately when clicked.
    - Use this to replace the generated "👉 Run" link for each dork (which is currently poorly implemented). I guess the "👉 Run" making script can also be removed.

**4. Create a DorkScript Syntax Highlighting Solution:**

    - Create a syntax highlighting solution for DorkScript that can be used across the site, including in code blocks in the docs and in the dork builder interface.
    - This could be a custom solution or an extension of an existing syntax highlighter like Prism.js or Highlight.js.
    - Implement linting and error highlighting for DorkScript in the dork builder interface to help users identify and fix syntax errors as they write their dorks.
