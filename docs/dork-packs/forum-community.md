## ⚠️ Ethical Framework

Community forums contain personal experiences and peer knowledge. Use responsibly:

- **Respect anonymity** - Never attempt to identify forum users
- **Don't screenshot identifying info** - Blur usernames when citing
- **Context matters** - Forum posts are informal; don't weaponize personal stories
- **Give back** - If you learn from communities, consider contributing
- **Trauma-informed** - Content may describe difficult experiences

**This pack is for understanding community perspectives, NOT surveillance.**
